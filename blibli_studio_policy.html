                            By collecting data on app usage and about your device and Generic geographic location, such as the city you are located in, we are better able to integrate updates, implement device specific testing, explore localisation opportunities and make better games that are tailored to our user's needs. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            When we offer our games as free-to-play, we still require the game to generate income to help fund development costs and efforts to make the best game possible. Advertising is one way we can help cover our costs, and in order to implement relevant advertising a certain amount of non-sensitive information is required by each ad network.
                            </p>
